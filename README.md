## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass nesting properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100svh;
}
```

### Continued development

Sizing the container, update the font size of some elements.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me for choosing the font.
- [Modzilla Developper Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
